In Docker, port binding, also known as port mapping, allows you to connect a port on your host machine to a port within a container, enabling external access to services running inside the container


Example : 
let our host port is 8080. we want to binding my sql port, which port is 3306
for this condition follow the bellow command

docker run -p8080:3306 Image_Name
